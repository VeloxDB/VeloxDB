* <xref:VeloxDB.ObjectInterface.ObjectModel>: The primary interface for interacting with the database. Provides methods for creating and retrieving objects, as well as executing queries.
* <xref:VeloxDB.ObjectInterface.DatabaseClassAttribute>: Attribute applied to classes to mark them as database classes.
* <xref:VeloxDB.ObjectInterface.DatabasePropertyAttribute>: Attribute applied to properties to mark them as database properties.
* <xref:VeloxDB.ObjectInterface.DatabaseReferenceAttribute>: Attribute applied to properties to mark them as references to other objects.
